This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: multiple mutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to create multiple mutable references to the same variable, leading to a compile-time error. The solution, found in `bugSolution.rs`, addresses this error by refactoring the code to avoid multiple mutable borrows, ensuring that only one mutable reference exists at any given time.
